Yama was last sighted in the North West and is believed to have a small kingdom of followes securing his palace. He is a worthy adversary even for an elite assassin and therefore the remuneration reflects this. The bounty will be paid upon receiving Yama Kenshin's head in The Founders capital of Ladzo City.",
