The first time I came across this disgusting goop it was attached to a poor clones head.\r\nThe clone seemed fine, he wasn't in pain even though he was bleeding from his crown.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end we held his head to a campfire to get the creep to leave. As soon as it came into contact with the flame it melted away into a small useless puddle of goop."
