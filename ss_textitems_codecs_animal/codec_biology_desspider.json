            "description": "[Author: Ira Barber] [Year: 4050]\r\nWhat a cute delight, these little spiders remind me of Earth's tarantulas, only bigger! I love their little eyes and dangly legs, sure they're a minor danger to the city but I think they're the cutest.\n\r\nMoreover the utility of these spiders web excites me, the web they emit can even stop a full grown adult clone. Amazing.\r\n\r\nIn the end we held his head to a campfire to get the creep to leave. As soon as it came into contact with the flame it melted away into a small useless puddle of goop."
