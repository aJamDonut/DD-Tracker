I've been alive for this long and still have to suffer the ignorance of my peers.\r\n\r\nBob How has really messed up this time, through every single calculation I've made it will be irreversible to correct the issues with our clones without some form of scientific breakthrough.\r\n\r\nI've been collecting local flora and fauna to see if it has any uses in the lab and I tried eating a few just out of curiosity... I know, it's a bad idea - and even worse I'm starting to feel the side effects.\r\n\r\nBut, with my own illness and Bobs eternal incompetence; I must continue in my work, I must find a solution to the cloning problems, otherwise given how hostile this planet is, we're all doomed.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason I have taken it upon myself to leave this wretched colony and begin more drastic experiments on my own\r\n\r\nI've stolen a remote science outpost and plan to make my way to the east. I'll begin my experiments in private and once I've figured it out I'll return the hero.\r\n\r\n"
