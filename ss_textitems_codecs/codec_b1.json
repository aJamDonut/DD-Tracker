How did I end up here? I thought I'd find adventure, friends and maybe more!\r\n\r\nOh well, I've gone long enough without a decents night sleep to know this isn't going to end well. Worse yet I can see the clone population growing while the human population is declining, this means eventually there must be no humans left! Imagine that! Would this even be a human colonized planet anymore? Or just some new civilization of bizarre mutated clones? A nightmare I've seen many times.\r\n\r\nIf I can't have my own adventures and humanity here is doomed, I might aswell begin to preserve the history of my time; so that clones and other cultures can learn from how this civilization began."
