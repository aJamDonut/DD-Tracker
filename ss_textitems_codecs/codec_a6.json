I've thought about making the journey north but I'm afraid I'm too old to survive the journey now.\r\n\r\nI regret not following Kenshin all those years ago, I should have followed my gut and not listened to Alex. Why do I always make these mistakes?\r\n\r\nI don't think it's too late for Ruoni to make the journey north. All we need is a map or a guide, that would do it. I pray every night for an angel to help."
