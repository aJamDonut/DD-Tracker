            "description": "[Author: Bob How] [Year: 4020]\r\nI've made a huge mistake. A mistake I will have to take to my grave. I don't know how I manage to live everyday with this fake smile and cracking such good jokes. I even impress myself sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe guilt of my mistake is too heavy and so I'm going to write my admission in the hopes of alleviating this weight on my chest. After all, got another day in the lab tomorrow. Oof with dreamy Ira. She's showing her age now but I'd stil enjoy a night on the chems with her, bet she would take 'em too.\r\n\r\nBah! Where to start, many years ago during the voyage to the new colony I was working late in the lab making chems, yknow - the usual, some PrepMeUp, DropMeDown and all that. Everything was going well and no one was around so I could make all the noise I wanted and get away with it.\r\n\r\nI guess I got a bit carried away and took the PrepMeUp before it had cooled down fully, and boooyyyyooo woooh! Never felt a hit so hard in my life. Before I knew what was going on I was swinging widly around the lab with insane strength.\r\n\r\nI blacked out and when I came to I was on the floor of the lab surrounded in PrepMeUp juice and a warning siren for the clone sequencer. My heart sank instantly I knew I must have done something during my intoxicated rage.\r\n\r\nI looked on the diagnostics screen and almost puked, all this way into space, only a few survivors and one goal to colonise a planet with clones. The screen reads... ... All DNA Sequences corrupted.\r\n\r\nGiven that we lost communication with earth 20 years ago, the only way to rectify the issue was a complete resequence, which on our best computers would take over a thousand years, or turn back to earth. We're already 50 years into this trip where many of the people on board have sacrificed those years to make this journey. Can I really be reponsible for all those lost years? Infact - another 50 years lost on the return? I CAN'T BARE THE THOUGHT!"
