Could you imagine how selfish you'd have to be to live almost 1000 years? How much you're stealing from nature, and others opportunities. This is what SinCorp stands for, this is what it sells.\r\n\r\nSinCorp holds no value to human life and just see's a price tag. Extending the life of the rich and bringing clones into existence without even a real family, wage or life, just to serve the highest bidder. Fracking disgusting.\r\n\r\nClones are living things too, with brains, emotions, capabilities the same as a human... Apart from reproduction and fully formed free choice. Who the frack made that choice? Imagine being trapped in your own body!\r\n\r\nToday I'm making the choice to leave all of this behind. This corporate run life of control and tyranny. I can't wait to be free. I have seen more and more clones getting past the gates every day. I will find them. I will help."
