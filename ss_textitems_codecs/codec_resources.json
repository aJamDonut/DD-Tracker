            "description": "[Author: Bob How] [Year: 4001]\r\nSo I suppose it's not all doom and gloom here. It looks like the trees and plants here at least offer something in the way of resources.\r\nJust setting a few clones on the trees for an hour yielded huge stacks of wood for us to use in manufacturing.\r\nThe plants work great as a fiber material too. It's surprising how well it performs when compare to Earthly materials."
